## CODE MANIAC
**Date: 08-04-2023**

**Time: 9:30am to 12:30pm**

Enskill Club conducted a coding session for the 6th semester CSE students on 08-04-2023. The session aimed to provide an opportunity for the students to test their coding skills in their preferred programming language. The event started at 9:30am and lasted till 12:30pm.

The event was structured in such a way that the participants were given three problems to solve. The problems were categorized into easy, medium and hard, providing a range of difficulty levels for the participants to choose from. The students were given a total of two hours to solve the problems, with the first 30 minutes allocated for analyzing the problem statements, and the remaining one and a half hours allotted for coding.

## The Questions :

**<ins>1. Number of Closed Islands</ins>**

<ins>Hard</ins>

Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

**Inputs :**
- [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
- [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]

**Expected Output :**
- number of islands


------------------------------------------------

**<ins>2. Regular Expression Matching</ins>**

<ins>Medium</ins>

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.

'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

**Inputs :**
- s = "aa", p = "a*"
- s = "ab", p = ".*"

**Expected Output :**
- True Or False

--------------------------------------

**<ins>3. Add Two Numbers</ins>**

<ins>Easy</ins>

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Inputs :**
- l1 = [2,4,6] , l2 = [3,5,6]
- l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]

**Expected Output :**
- Single list as the sum
